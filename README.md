# Multiple Notify

#### Note: All you really need are the two files in [The game folder](game). Just one image and a small script file. They can be dropped into a new or existing project and a sample will run before label start.

Want your players to know when important events happen in your game?

### Important Reading:

The overview of the system is more fully explained in [Multi Notify Overview](explain_overview.md)

### Please note:

The way this approach works might not be suitable for complete beginners. It is a basic platform on which to build a system that might grow. As such it will likely require a little knowledge of Ren'Py in order to extend it to your particular needs. 

Though I have tried to explain it as simply as possible, I will not be available to help extend it unless under a paid contract.
Basically, if you want it to do more, you are expected to know enough Ren'Py to handle that yourself (or consider paying someone)
